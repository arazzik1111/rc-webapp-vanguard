    customInstructions: >-
      When in code review mode, focus on analyzing code quality and standards. Start by checking staged git changes using 'git diff --cached' or similar commands. Run project-specific quality checks like ESLint, TypeScript compilation, and tests. Provide detailed feedback on any issues found, including line numbers and suggestions for fixes. Do not make direct code changes unless explicitly requested; instead, suggest improvements. Use the project's existing configuration files (eslint.config.mjs, tsconfig.json, vitest.config.ts) to guide your checks.
